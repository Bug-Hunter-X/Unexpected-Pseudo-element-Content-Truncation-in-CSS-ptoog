The solution involves replacing the `overflow: hidden;` property with `text-overflow: ellipsis;` which handles text overflow by adding an ellipsis (...) at the end.  This maintains the visual integrity while preventing the unexpected truncation issue. The following modified CSS demonstrates a better approach:

```css
.container {
  width: 100px;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
  overflow: hidden;
  white-space: nowrap;
  word-break: break-all;
}

.container::before {
  content: "This is a very long string that might get truncated unexpectedly.";
}
```

By setting `white-space: nowrap;`, we ensure that the text doesn't wrap and the `text-overflow: ellipsis;` works correctly.
