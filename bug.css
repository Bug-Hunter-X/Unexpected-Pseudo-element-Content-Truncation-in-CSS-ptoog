The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an unusual issue where a pseudo-element's content is unexpectedly truncated due to a combination of `word-break: break-all;` and `overflow: hidden;` applied to a parent element. This might not be a widely known problem and can manifest in different ways based on browser behavior and text length.

```css
.container {
  width: 100px;
  overflow: hidden;
  word-break: break-all;
}

.container::before {
  content: "This is a very long string that might get truncated unexpectedly.";
}
```

This is a complex situation because `word-break: break-all;` usually handles long words, but when combined with `overflow: hidden;` on the parent, it can lead to unexpected truncation within the pseudo-element content.
